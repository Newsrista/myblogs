So as most of you know the new Copilot+ PCs from Microsoft are coming out soon. They promise quite a lot stating, "they are up to 20x more powerful  and up to 100x as efficient" compared to their predecessors. In this blog let's dive into the countless features and the abilities of the Copilot+ PCs.

## The Features: 

There are a countless number of features, so I will simply go over the top 5 most important and interesting ones:

1. Recall (Arguably the best feature of the Copilot+ PCs): The feature takes snapshots of everything you do on your PC. You can then scroll back to or search for something you were working on in the past.

2. Advanced AI Models and NPU: The PCs have integrated high performance Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and advanced AI models, the PC is just specializing in AI and assistance.

3. Cocreator: This feature is great for content creation because it allows for great AI-powered image creation and editing capabilities built into Windows. So it's a built-in AI image creator and AI editor.

4. Extended Battery Life: I know that it is not such a big deal, but Microsoft promises a full day of battery life, much better than the original 2 hours you get from older laptops. 

5. Live Captions with Translation: Real-time translation of audio from over 40 languages into English, providing English-language captions across all applications and platforms, even offline.

There are many more features which I couldn't include in this post, like the many partnerships with major apps, but you can just check it out on your own at the Microsoft website.

## My Thoughts:

My relationship with Microsoft is weird. I used to own a Windows computer however, it was simply a poor performing laptop with terrible battery life and capabilities. However, I do love Microsoft in terms of a company and I wouldn't say I am not exciting for these PCs, but the thing is I just switched to the dark sides (I bought a Mac) so I can't turn back now. However, there were countless comparisons to the MacBook Air saying, "20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15”." and "they outperform Apple’s MacBook Air 15” by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance" which leaves me to believe they may have the potential to outperform Apple for once. 

The only problem I see is that I don't think enough people are that hyped around this product. The starting price of $999 is cheaper than their rival's bestseller the MacBook Pro which is starting at an outrageous $1599. However, $999 is not cheap enough for it to be accessible to many people which leaves me to believe that many people won't buy it. 

## Other's Criticism:

There are also a few criticisms of the Copilot+ PCs so far so let's get into them.

1. Privacy Concerns: One of the major criticisms of the Copilot+ PCs is related to privacy (like all Windows Laptops). Users are worried about the extensive data collection required for features like Recall, which keeps track of everything seen or done on the PC. This criticism is valid, as if any normal person has access to your PC this could cause you to lose accounts for various applications. Also, many critics say that Microsoft could potentially misuse the personal data it collected.

2. Excessive Focus on AI: Some users feel that the industry's current obsession with AI is overwhelming and unnecessary. They argue that the push for more AI integration in everyday tasks might not be as beneficial as advertised and could be more about data collection than actual user benefit. Also, personally the major focus on AI could lead to other features of the PCs to be subpar.

3. Performance vs. Practicality: There are concerns about whether the significant performance claims, like being 20x more powerful for AI workloads, truly translate into practical benefit for average users. Some critics also believe Microsoft may be exaggerating the performance of the PCs. They also question if these enhancements justify the cost and whether they offer tangible improvements over existing technology.

4. Windows 11 Experience: For me Windows 10 beats 11 by a landslide and many others think so too. Windows 11 has received mixed reviews, with some describing it as bloated and unpleasant to use. The criticism extends to the Copilot+ PCs, as they run on Windows 11 and are seen as a part of the same ecosystem. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, while the new features and AI capabilities of Copilot+ PCs are impressive on paper, the reception has been due to privacy concerns, skepticism about the AI focus, and general dissatisfaction with Windows 11 operating system.
